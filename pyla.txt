# Pyla AI Bot Tutorial and Troubleshooting Guide

## System Requirements and Setup

### Screen Resolution
- Only 1920x1080 screen settings are supported
- Ensure your Windows display settings are set to 1920x1080, not just in the emulator

### Emulator
- Currently only fully supports LDPlayer
- BlueStacks is not fully supported and may lack advanced features

### LDPlayer Setup
- Start LDPlayer and press the middle button on the top right to maximize the window
- Do not use F11 fullscreen; tabs on the top left should be visible
- LDPlayer should be in fullscreen windowed mode with Windows taskbar visible

### Python Installation
- Install Python 3.11 or newer
- During installation, check the box "Add to PATH"
- Restart your PC after installation

## Bot Capabilities

### Supported Playstyle
- Currently only works on the "ranged" playstyle
- Supported brawlers:
  ["8bit", "barley", "bea", "belle", "bo", "bonnie", "brock", "byron", "carl", "charlie", "colette",
  "colt", "crow", "penny", "piper", "poco", "rico", "rt", "ruffs", "dynamike", "emz", "eve", "gale",
  "gene", "grom", "gray", "jessie", "larry_lawrie", "leon", "griff", "gus", "lola", "lou", "mandy", "maisie",
  "mrp", "nani", "otis", "pam", "spike", "sprout", "stu", "squeak", "tara", "tick", "willow", "berry"]
- Ranges are defined in `ranges.toml`
- You can edit ranges if the bot's shooting behavior needs adjustment

## Starting the Bot

1. Click the brawler you want the bot to play
2. Select "trophies" or "masteries" farming mode
3. Enter the brawler's current trophies and masteries
4. Set the goal under "push until"
5. Open Brawl Stars on LDPlayer, stay in the lobby
6. Click start on the bot menu
7. Do not move anything after starting

## Game Mode Configuration

For 5v5 horizontal maps (vertical are same as 3v3):
1. Go to the `cfg` folder
2. Open `game_mode.toml` with a text editor
3. Change the "type" to:
   - 3 for vertical
   - 5 for horizontal
Note: Some 5v5 maps are vertical like normal 3v3. Set these to "3"

## Key Setup
- Set "e" for the super button
- Set "q" for the middle of the "play" button

## Stopping the Bot
Move your mouse to any corner of the screen

## Common Issues and Solutions

### File Extraction
If you can't find "start.bat", ensure you've extracted the .zip file entirely and correctly.

### Bot Dying in Hazardous Areas
The bot is designed for 3v3 game modes, not for showdown. Use only in 3v3 modes.

### Bot Behavior
The bot is programmed to move forward and attack. This is normal for 3v3 modes.

### Interface Interaction Issues
If the bot interacts with unintended elements (shop, profile):
- Ensure LDPlayer is maximized (full screen with Windows taskbar visible)
- Verify Windows screen resolution is 1920x1080

### Bot Getting Stuck
If the bot doesn't launch a game or enter the profile after selecting a brawler:
- Select "trophies" or "masteries" when submitting a brawler
- Set up emulator keys as instructed in the #download-guide

### Incorrect Clicking
If the bot doesn't click correctly:
1. Go to the `cfg` folder
2. Open `lobby_config.toml` with a text editor
3. Edit the coordinates for your specific case
   - Coords format: `[x1, y1]` and `[x1, y1, width, height]`
   - Use Mofiki's Coordinate Finder tool to find correct coords
   - Tool download: [Mofiki's Coordinate Finder](https://www.mediafire.com/file/weq2zklef8h5hv8/Mofiki%2527s_Coordinate_Finder.zip/file)
   - Video tutorial: [Changing Coordinates](https://youtu.be/Pxo7WgfcvwM)

Example: If the bot clicks above the brawlers button, increase the y1 value in `brawlers_btn = [130, 450]`.

### Matplotlib Issues
If you encounter a "Matplotlib failed to acquire the following lock file" error, delete the file at the specified path (e.g., "C:\Users\[USER]\matplotlib\fontlist-v390.json.matplotlib-lock") and restart Pyla. Replace [USER] with your username.

### Ultralytics Requirements
If you see an error about Ultralytics requirements ['onnx', 'onnxruntime'] not found, wait a few minutes and then restart Pyla.

### Brawler Data Input Box Not Opening
If the box for inputting brawler data isn't opening:
1. Check the console content
2. If nothing appears, press ctrl + c in the console
3. Send what appears in the console to support staff
4. Wait for staff assistance

### Warning Messages
If you see a warning message like "WARNING Unable to automatically guess model task, assuming 'task=detect'":
- This is just a warning, not an error
- Continue using the bot as normal
- Report to staff if the issue persists or if the bot gets stuck indefinitely

### KeyError
If you encounter a KeyError:
- Make sure to select if you want the bot to farm "mastery" or "trophies" when submitting a brawler
- This selection is crucial for proper bot operation

### Bot Not Moving
If the bot doesn't move or sits there:
1. First verify that all the emulator keys (found in #download-guide) are present
2. If all keys are set up correctly, send the content of the console to support staff for error identification

### Unsolvable Issues
If you encounter an issue that you can't solve or isn't covered in this guide:
1. Open a ticket if not already done
2. Send a video recording of the issue
3. Provide as much detail as possible about the problem and steps to reproduce it

### Console Information
For many issues, checking the console output is crucial:
- Look for error messages or unexpected output
- When reporting issues, always include the console content if possible
- Use ctrl + c in the console to copy its content if needed
